# üí°  Problem Statement

Beneath Protocol addresses the insecurity of traditional email systems like Gmail and SMTP. By leveraging blockchain security, it offers a secure protocol, guarding against unauthorized access and impersonation. Beyond security, it enables cross-chain communication and ensures backward compatibility, facilitating seamless communication between web3 and web2 and vice versa. ‚ú®üî•

# üí™ Goals

- To revolutionize email systems by employing blockchain security to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

# üß† Knowledge Primer

- [Zetachain](https://www.zetachain.com/) is a layer 1 blockchain and developer platform that connects any L1 and L2, from Ethereum to Bitcoin and beyond. Access all of crypto in one place.
- [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) is a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that powers fast smart contract transactions while reducing transaction costs.
- [Lighthouse Storage](https://www.lighthouse.storage/) is a permanent file storage protocol that allows the ability to pay once and store files forever.
- [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is making the web more secure and efficient with a decentralized data storage marketplace, protocol, and cryptocurrency.
- [Push Protocol](https://push.org/) is a decentralized communication protocol for Web3! Using which any dApps, smart contracts, backends or protocols can send communication (starting with on-chain / off-chain / gasless notifs) tied to user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform agnostic fashion.
- [Base](https://base.org/) is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain.



# Features

- **Interoperability:** Unifying disparate blockchain networks, Beneath Protocol allows users to effortlessly transmit emails, overcoming the barriers between Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Zetachain.
  
- **Arbitrum Integration:** Acting as a central hub, Arbitrum hosts servers, manages requests, and orchestrates events to ensure smooth cross-chain email transmission.

- **SDK Customization:** Empowering users with the flexibility to create personalized emails using a robust Software Development Kit (SDK), enhancing communication adaptability.

- **Scroll Foundation:** The Scroll component serves as the cornerstone for deploying Beneath Protocol's central contract, efficiently managing email mapping and ensuring a structured communication system.

- **Zetachain Connectivity:** Serving as a crucial bridge, Zetachain facilitates seamless cross-chain communication, connecting Polygon and Zetachain and using us connecting it to other chains

- **Push Protocol:** Elevating user experience with real-time notifications and fostering immediate communication among peers. The addition of Push Space enables group chat functionalities, particularly beneficial within shared domains like office or college email systems.

- **Lighthouse Storage and Filecoin:** Prioritizing secure off-chain storage security and confidentiality, Beneath Protocol utilizes  to store emails in encrypted form, ensuring the integrity of one-to-one communication between senders and receivers.

- **Base:** Acting as the foundation for consumer product production, Base hosts servers on its chain, efficiently managing user requests, storage allocation, and associated events for seamless email transmission with¬†other¬†chains.

The smart contract has been deployed on Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, ZetaChain.

# ‚è≠Ô∏è What's next

Our journey continues as we strive to enhance Beneath Protocol and the whole Blockchain ecosystem. Here's what's on the horizon:
- Join more chains on our protocol.
- Making a SDK that can be used

#   Challenges we ran into

- Chainlink CCIP Integration Issues
We initially planned to leverage Chainlink CCIP functionality for cross-chain communication. Despite investing significant effort and collaboration with the Chainlink Developer team, we encountered challenges. Developer issues on the Chainlink side and a lack of code updates in their docs posed hurdles. After exhaustive attempts and communication with the Chainlink team, we were advised to discontinue its use due to insurmountable challenges. This setback consumed a considerable portion of our time during the hackathon. Subsequently, we pivoted to developing our own decentralized protocol for achieving similar cross-chain communication goals, facilitating communication between different chains and bridging the gap between web3 and web2.

- NextJS and Integration with Push Space and WebUI Kit
While working with NextJS, we faced an unexpected roadblock during the integration of Push Space and WebUI Kit. An error arose, and upon consulting with the Push team, we discovered that resolving the issue within NextJS would be complex and impractical. Given that Push was a crucial feature in our project, we made the difficult decision to transition from NextJS to React. This necessitated re-implementing all functionalities within a tight time frame of less than 6 hours before the submission deadline. The team persevered through exhaustion to successfully migrate the project.

- Learning Curve with New Technologies
Our project involved a plethora of new technologies, including Zetachain, Arbitrum, Base, Push, and Lighthouse Storage. The learning curve for these technologies was steep, leading to initial challenges in navigating the documentation and understanding the intricacies of each. However, the well-maintained documentation and the responsiveness of the developer teams played a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. Despite the initial struggles, the support provided helped us gain proficiency in these technologies and use them.
